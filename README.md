## Travel card reader for Sailfish OS

![icon](icons/86x86/harbour-matkakortti.png)

Application for reading [Helsinki](https://www.hsl.fi/en/changecard) and
[Tampere](https://joukkoliikenne.tampere.fi/liput-ja-hinnat/tampereen-matkakortti.html)
travel cards. The information describing NFC API and data format for HSL cards and
even some documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/hsl-card-java)
(in Finnish).

Obviously, this application only works on those phones where NFC is
[supported](https://jolla.com/sailfishx) by Sailfish OS, e.g. Sony Xperia XA2
or Xperia 10. Support for **Tampere** travel cards requires **Sailfish OS 3.3.0**
or later - earlier versions of Sailfish OS handled Tampere cards in such a way
that made those cards unhappy and unwilling to work.
